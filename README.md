üß© Tech Stack

Search, filtering, and category navigation

Persistent cart and user session using localStorage

‚öôÔ∏è Admin & Demo Accounts

For a demo, you can create accounts using the Signup UI. If you'd like seed accounts, create a seed.json or add them programmatically in localStorage on first load.

Example seed script (run once in console):

localStorage.setItem('users', JSON.stringify([
  { id: 1, name: 'Admin', email: 'admin@prizeify.com', role: 'admin', password: 'admin123' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Customer', email: 'customer@prizeify.com', role: 'user', password: 'cust123' }
]));
üß© Implementation Notes

localStorage keys used: users, products, cart, orders, session

Keep authentication logic on client side only for demo purposes. For production, replace with a secure backend (JWTs, hashed passwords, HTTPS).

Admin routes should be guarded by checking the session role and redirecting unauthenticated users to login.



‚úÖ Good-to-have enhancements

Real backend (Node/Express + MongoDB ) for auth & product storage

Wishlist & order tracking

Unit + integration tests
